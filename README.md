**Ever felt like the vanilla music discs just don't hit the vibe of your base?** Stop settling for *Cat* or *Stal* and start spinning your own tracks. **Dash's Custom Music Discs** allows you to burn real-world `.mp3` files onto blank discs and play them in any standard Jukebox.

## ✨ Impressive Features

* 🎼 **Dynamic Audio Streaming**: Powered by an isolated **JLayer engine**, your music streams directly without bloat or massive resource packs.
* 📡 **Proximity-Based Sound**: Just like vanilla discs! The music gets quieter as you walk away and fades out completely at 64 blocks.
* 🎚️ **Smart Jukebox Logic**: Discs behave exactly as they should. Breaking the jukebox, ejecting the disc, or even a hopper pulling the record will instantly stop the audio.
* 🖥️ **Seamless GUI Burning**: No commands, no config digging. Just right-click with the **Disc Burner** to open the interface and burn your favorite tunes.
* 🤝 **Mod Compatibility**: Designed to work alongside other music mods without interfering with their keybinds or global playlists.

## 📂 Technical Details

* **Storage**: Burned music is stored server-side in `config/uploaded_music/`.
